 5. Which one is the most popular station? 
      - we did analysis and draw bar charts of top 5 starting station & bottom 5 starting station.
      - Also did analysis on top 5 departing & arriving station for both customers & subscribers.
 6. Hypothesis test 
      - we did a ttest by dividing into two groups - one is Morning period & other is evening period.
      - we try to do test by using Tripduration attribute for calculating mean value
      - it gives us p-value < 0.05. which means it's a "reject to null hypothesis"
      - graph proves us that evening tripduration are a lot more than morning one
